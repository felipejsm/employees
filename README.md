## Employees Project

From the sample provided by the Mysql team(check it out [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/sakila-structure.html)), I've built an implementation in Java 17, Spring Boot 3, and some other goodies from Java environment.  
This project aims to demonstrate JPA techniques and lambdas + streams usage.
